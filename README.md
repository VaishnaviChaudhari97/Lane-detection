# lane-detection
This repository contains code for detecting lane for a track

Lane detection using OpenCV. This code consists of grayscaling images, smoothening of the image, detecting the edges, finding the region of interest, performing bitwise and operations, implementing the concepts of Hough Transformation and executing the code for a track video to detect lanes.
